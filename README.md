# S02P01 Build First Process

This **VB** project is my solution to the **Building The Process** practice found in section 02 practice 01 for the UiPath - Automation Explorer course.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### Practice Requirements

###### Business scenario:

Each day, ACME's Sales department receives reports from coffee shops in Excel format.
A dedicated member of the team extracts the data from each report, merges it into an Excel spreadsheet, and then creates a pivot table and a chart based on the merged data.

**Course:** UiPath - Automation Explorer

**Section:** 02 Build your first process with Studio

**Practice:** 01 Building the process

**Project Format:** Windows, VB

**GitHub:** https://github.com/ShonHarsh/UiPath-AE-S02P01-BuildFirstProcess-VB

### Sample Output

```sh

```

### Architecture Requirements

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
